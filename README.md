# FACE-RECOGNITION-STAFF-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
The following code is in python it shows how the attendance staff system is recorded by programming cameras that can be set at the gate. This cameras are programmed to recognize a face then it is automatically recorded in the database.
The database will have the time in and time out of the staff member. 
The system first has to be trained with the images of the individuals.
I used the openCV for the system.
